                    <p>Acquaint yourself with the case and the suspects before viewing the evidence.</p>
                    <h2>The Backstory</h2>
                    <p>Madam M. Mary Magenta, a retired business woman and widow of the
                        late Major M. Methuselah Magenta, invited five guests to her suburban
                        home for a mysterious gathering. Little to the guests knowledge, Madam
                        Magenta is sometimes referred to as “The Matchmaker.” In fact, she was
                        interviewing each of them as potential romantic candidates for others
                        she knows. The guests thought this quite odd, but went along with it out
                        of kindness towards Madam Magenta, and their own longing hearts.
                        Unfortunately, the local police have been having some internal difficulties
                        and weren’t able to get to the scene immediately. Only digital evidence
                        could be gathered to figure out the solution to the crime.</p>
