                    <h2>The Backstory</h2>
                    <p>Monsieur Mateo Midnight was a famed logician. One fine June evening he
                        decided to have five guests over to teach them all he knew of logic; he did
                        this out of love of the craft, or, maybe, just sheer boredom. Unfortunately,
                        one of the guests didn’t take a liking to Monsieur Midnight’s wordy
                        games and killed him. However, the only directions to Monsieur
                        Midnight’s house were too confusing for the police to arrive immediately.
                        Therefore, they had to take statements, digitally, from each of the guests.
                        However, they had become so versed in Monsieur Midnight’s teachings
                        that their statements were clouded in syllogistic jargon. <br><br>(NOTE: Assume that if a 
                        characters states something straightforwardly such as "I was in X when the murder occurred", then they are telling the truth)</p>
